    "extracted_text": "The essay argues that most productivity systems fail because people over-optimize tools instead of outcomes. It offers a few examples but mostly focuses on opinion. It briefly suggests one concrete practice: define a weekly output goal and reject inputs that do not support it. Beyond that, it does not provide a step-by-step method or measurable checklist."
