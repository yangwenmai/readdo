    "extracted_text": "The article introduces a lightweight postmortem template: context, impact, timeline, contributing factors, actions, and follow-ups. It argues that good templates reduce handoff by making expectations explicit. It recommends storing templates in version control and validating outputs against a schema. The piece includes practical examples of action items with owners and ETAs, and suggests measuring completion rate as a feedback loop."
