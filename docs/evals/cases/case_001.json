    "extracted_text": "This article proposes a system design checklist for AI-native products. It emphasizes defining artifacts, contracts, and evaluations before building UI. It outlines a pipeline approach: extract, summarize, score, generate actions, then ship outputs. It also warns that without versioned artifacts and schema validation, model outputs drift and break user trust. The author provides a step-by-step framework: 1) define user journey, 2) define artifacts and schemas, 3) implement orchestrator with state machine, 4) add evaluations, 5) iterate templates. The piece includes examples of failure handling and retry strategies."
