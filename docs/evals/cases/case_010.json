    "extracted_text": "The analysis compares web-based MVPs with desktop shells like Tauri. It argues web MVPs ship faster and reduce OS-specific issues, while desktop enables system integration and stronger local-first UX. It recommends designing a portable core engine and keeping UI as a replaceable layer. It suggests starting with a local backend + web UI, then moving to Tauri when product-market fit is clearer. It also discusses risks: signing, permissions, rendering differences, and update mechanisms."
