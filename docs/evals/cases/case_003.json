    "extracted_text": "The post compares lightweight readability-based extraction with headless browser rendering. It argues that for MVP, a readability parser plus careful normalization is usually enough, while headless browsers add complexity. It recommends storing the normalized text and a hash for reproducibility. When extraction fails, it suggests a user-facing fallback: allow pasting the article text manually. The author also stresses instrumenting extraction failures with error codes and retryability flags."
